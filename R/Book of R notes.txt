Installing Packages
There are thousands of contributed packages not included with the typical R installation; to make them loadable in R, you must first download and
install them from a repository (usually CRAN). The easiest way to do this is
by using the install.packages function directly at the R prompt (for this you
need an Internet connection).
For example, one such package is ks (Duong, 2007), which youâ€™ll use in
Chapter 26. Executing the following will attempt to connect to your local
CRAN mirror and download and install ks, as well as several packages upon
which it relies (called dependencies):

Updating
update.packages()

?<command> will launch a help file
??<"partial command"> will searcg everywhere for a refernce
